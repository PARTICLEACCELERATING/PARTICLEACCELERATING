		open to interactions if i dont have a dni in my name !!!!
		  _spam followers will be blocked .. nothing against y'all though !_
              
			STATUS MEANINGS ! !!
	➳ Offline: Hiding, dniuc probably upset / or in a bad mood !
	➳ Away : most likely offtab, may be afk  !
	➳ Looking for chat : Interact!!!! PLEASE !!!! PLSPLSPLSPLSPLSPLSSSSSS... 
	➳ Looking for roleplay : I never use this one .. maybe i'm in a roleplay on party island ?? or for looks ?.
	➳ Busy : most likely im doing schoolwork/research, may be exhausted / have a low social battery (best way to tell is if i
	 respond slowly to multiple interactions & like we're having a convo and i'm taking a while/not using caps/ not coming
	 off as ecstatic / excited !), if im in a lower mood please keep in mind you can still int normally, its just more likely 
	 that i will get annoyed/irritated and if i do i will probably leave the game, but dont be scared 2 int w/ me on ponytown 
	 AT ALL PLS !!!
	➳ Online : Free 2 int, i'm most likely doing something but am in game like making ponies or @ docks game, or i am offtab /
	doing something on another device but can see ponytown or i am checking ponytown very often !!
		
  	w2i is encouraged , i might miss your message otherwise !!! also, i have a bad habit of closing my ponytown tab
	before seeing if i have any whispers so if you whisper me something and i don't respond and leave like 1-8 minutes
	later, that is likely the reason .. sometimes i lose whispers this way and i am VERY SORRY !!! never be afraid to double
	whisper if i dont respond !

			
			NAME ABBREVIATES + MEANINGS !!
	➳ W2I: Whisper to interact !
	➳ C+H: Cuddles and hiding behind me is okay + encouraged !! you can also cuddle in front of me, i don't mind & 
	  i love when people do that !! ^_^
	➳ dniuf: do not interact unless friend
	➳ dniuc: do not interact unless close 
	➳ iwc: interact with caution + care
	➳ iwec: interact with extreme caution + care
	➳ int: interact freely!


			BYI / ABT ME ! ? !
	➳ I'm a minor, do NOT be sexual / suggestive to/with/near me, please.
	➳ i sometimes make kms jokes + say the f slur (reclaimable fur me) ! if you do not like this PLEASE tell me !!!
	➳ i call everyone bro/vro + comrade + dude + pookie + oomfie (if we're friended) !
	➳ i make some typos on purrpose + also i type fast so i may make a lot , if you use a screen reader or struggle
	   to read typos then lmk and i will make my best effort to type in an easier to (screen)read way !! :D
	➳ i tend to get very scared to interact with people even if they are friends and we talk a lot , this usually happens
	   when we haven't talked in more than a few days (even if i have been offline for a few days) or you message me on 
	   another site (like discord) and i havent replied in a day or two (most likely i lost track of time, or didnt know 
	   how/have the energy to reply), i get fearful that you will hate me or look down on me in a negative light or 
	   something like this (i know its illogical but i havent figured out a way to get over this yet), so i go longer and 
	   longer without replying and then i end up ghosting people for months .. if i do this to you i am VERY sorry , but 
	   pls know i do not mean any ill will / im not trying to avoid you or anything ..
	➳ i mirror the attitude of people i talk to and stuff , like the way you talk; if you will be hyper to me i will be to you
	  etc etc  ! i also kinda steal phrases people say, like how "ok? ok!" is becoming more widespread, just like little language
	  quirks you use that i think convey meaning in a way i also could use ! its very fun ..
	  		!! if you want me to not do any of these things PLEASEPLSPLSPLSPLS TEL ME!!!!! i don't want to make anyone
			uncomfortable !! (pls also be as specific as you can so this does not happen again ) (if you are also scared to tell
			me whatever it is to my face [i understand this .. i do this too..] you can send it to my strawpg anonymously & i will
			not post it !)
	
	➳ DONT BE AFRAID TO INT FIRST EVEN IF ITS JUST LIKE A ' HI ' PLEASE !! 
	➳ i might not understand what you're saying sometimes .. i'm kinda mousebrained lwokey .. if my reply doesn't make 
	 sense w/ what you said please tell me but also try and simplify it pls  !
  

			THINGS I LIKE ! !! ( vaguely ordered in current interest level !)
		im going to be honest i have a super ultra mega TERRIBLE memory and so i forgor literally everything that 
		happened in 90% of these medias, these are just things i know ive liked in the past and idk .. idk why im putting
		them here if i dont remember them because we wouldnt be able to talk about them .. but i still want to put them here..
		so uh keep that in mind i guess . !
	➳ STOMACHBOOK !!!! I LOVE STUMMYBOOK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
	➳ captainsparklez i lobe you captainsparklez oh my golly . hit me up if yew want some captainsparkle Facts i have a note doc
	  wit a bunch of them .. hes just always been something i like .. which is crazy because watchign him is kinda torturous 
	  because he can be a BRICK sometimes LMAO ?? but I LOVE WATCHING HIM it makes me so Hapy.. coughs though i will say i havent
	  seen anywhere near all his stuff , currently im watching ragnamod and 
	➳ ii  (i havent watched s4 because im scared itll make me hate ii and its like a super mega comfort show for me..)
	➳ phighting!  
	➳ dandy world  
	➳ mcsr (lowkey mainly feinberg and hbg though ) (and rakrep!)
	➳ hfjone . Oh hfjone how i love you so... 
	➳ LMK  OMGAAHJAHJJGVASGASJH!!!!!
	➳ bfdi/tpot !!!
	➳ the stanley parable !
	➳ reading enjoyuers ( ????...) (THINKMAXXERS ?.../hj)
		idk how 2 put this one, specifically not based on certain reading fandoms, but like people who enjoy thinking about
		specifically the themes/motifs/(general literary devices)/ what the books MEAN !!!! like WHY did the author put THIS 
		??? or OOOH IM READING THIS AND I THINK THIS IS FORESHADOWING OMG ?? , things like that !! like feel free 2 talk to
		me about something like this in a book you're reading even if i don't know it !! [also this could not even HAVE to 
		be related to books, like just this "style" of things in a favourite media of yours !!] 
	➳ hermitcraft / life series fans !
	➳ people who like music .. . yep ! (?...)
		like if yew have any song recs... hit me up!! can't guarantee i'll listen to them sometime this decade but rest 
		 assured i do have a list i put them all on and fully intend to listen to them all ! i also have listened to a 
		 lot of songs (8.6k total ahaha...) so if you want some recs feel free 2 ask, but i considering i am very forgetful i 
		 may not be able to give you very many if its something more complex ,,
	** specific books ive read of mine !** (listed in order of like how much i remember/what i recently read !)
		➳ ALL charlotte mcconaghy books (wild dark shore, migrations, once there were wolves) 
		 please GENUINELY consider reading these.  pls . if you are able to enjoy reading, or even jsut if you don't absolutely 
		 loathe having to read they are SO. fucking good and i would attribute reading these to teaching me how to actually 
		 critically think about books. they're GOATED . HOWEVER !!! they do also contain triggering topics !! i would recommend
		 looking at doesthedogdie.com to find them, or if you don't want to be "spoiled" (?) for everything but rather your 
		 specific triggers, you can ask me (best would be atabook) (strawpage is good too ! ) ( also good when im on looking
		 for chat on ponytown, but i will probably not be able to give good details on what pages to avoid and stuff because 
		 i will have to .. yknow.. get the book at that moment.. and i might not have access to it, so it would work best 
		 for general trigger warnings !), just tell me which ones you have and i can tell you if they are in each book, and 
		 like what specific pages to avoid, or if they are very graphic, and things like this ! ( although triggers that i
		 do not remember/know well enough to warn for would be a fear of the ocean [like for instance there's a lot of 
		 oceans in these books but i don't know if the scenes in which they are there/how they're described/what transpires 
		 would be very triggering or not very triggering) (but if you tell me what things specifically are triggering i 
		 could figure it out from there, a fear/triggered by knives / weapons, & i can't think of others but uhm.. it 
		 all depends just ask !!! i want like EVERYONE to be able to read these books because they are AMAZING so i want 
		 to make that as possible for everyone !!
		➳ the poisonwood bible by barbara kingsolver 
			currently reading this one, it is VERY good so far ! it might seem like a more daunting book / dense / idk hard to 
			read if you enjoy lighter/funner fiction, and while there are certainly dark moments and themes there is genuinely a 
			lot of funny things in this book so i recommend you read it !! i know it doesn't sound like i have much to say about
			this one but its because most of my Thoughts About Books come after ive read most/all of the book, but this
			book is just BEAUTIFULLY written so far like i LOVE her writing style its SO AMAZING !!!	
		➳ keeper of the lost cities by shannon messenger
			oh keeper oh keeper.. on the one hand yay fun magial girl fun fantasy book series !! honestly a very fun read 
			if you don't want to be thinking deeply about it, but it still has things that certainly Make you think ,, like 
			this book series isn't the _best_ written ? which is to say the writing style is very readable but i mean idk
			the society of this world and the events in these books sorta reveal some biases from the auther (although maybe
			they could be  ebcause of the publisher but idk). and. there's certainly Themes here! yep. PLEASE FINISH 
			WRITING TH ENEXT BOOK ITS BEEN ALMOST FOUR YEARS AND 9 ENDED ON THE BIGGEST CLIFFHANGER EVER !!!! PLEASE!!!!!.
			in general i have read this one very recently so i basically remember everything (like every event/character) 
			and could have good conversations about it methinks !!!! also #tiertice4life. and quinlin and alden .and della 
			and livvy. #why are there so many pining queers pining for people who are MARRIED ? WHAT IS THIS TOMFOOLERY /j!!
